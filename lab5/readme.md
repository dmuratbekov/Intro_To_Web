# Lab 5
## Introduction to Python Basics

In this laboratory work, I reviewed the basic setup for Python development and focused on learning fundamental Python syntax.  
Since Python and PyCharm were already installed in previous laboratory works, no additional installation was required. The main emphasis of this lab was writing simple Python programs and understanding core language concepts.

## Development Environment
At the beginning of the laboratory work, I confirmed that Python and PyCharm were already installed and configured correctly.

- Python interpreter was available
- PyCharm Community Edition was used
- A new project named **lab5** was created in PyCharm
- Python interpreter was detected automatically

## First Python Program
A new Python file named `hello_world.py` was created.

In this file:
- A simple Python program was written
- The program was executed directly from PyCharm
- The output **"Hello, world!"** was displayed in the console

This step confirmed that the development environment was working correctly.

## Exercises

Ex 1:
- Created a variable and assigned my name to it
- Created two numeric variables and performed addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Swapped values of two variables without using a temporary variable
- Created a constant for the value of π and calculated the area of a circle with a given radius

Ex 2:
- Take a user’s name and age as input and display a formatted sentence
- Take three numeric values as input and calculate their sum, average, and product
