# Lab 1
### Installing Python
In this laboratory work, I installed and configured Python as a development environment.  
The work focused on understanding the basic components of Python and preparing the system for further programming tasks.

## Python Setup

### Python Interpreter## 💻 Installation Process
I downloaded Python from the official website:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/

The installation was completed using the default settings, and Python was added to the system PATH.

---
## Verification
To ensure the installation was successful, I verified it using the command line.

```bash
python --version
#or
python3 --version
```
I also confirmed that pip was installed correctly:
```bash
pip --version
```


### Development Environment
I prepared a basic development environment for future work.
A virtual environment was created and activated to manage dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

### Notes
- Python 3.x was used
- The installation was verified successfully
- Virtual environments will be used in future projects
