# Lab 8
# Working with Functions

---

## What I did
In this lab, I learned how to work with functions in Python and practiced creating and using them in different scenarios.
I defined functions using the def keyword and called them to execute code.

## Function Features
I practiced:
- Function parameters and passing arguments
- Default parameters
- Returning values using return
- Returning multiple values from a function
- Using *args to pass multiple positional arguments
- Using **kwargs to pass keyword arguments
- Writing lambda functions for simple operations
- Understanding local and global variable scope

## Exercises
I completed the following tasks:
- Wrote a function to calculate the square of a number
- Created a function that returns the sum of a list of numbers
- Implemented a recursive Fibonacci function
- Wrote a function to check whether a number is prime
