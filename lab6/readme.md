# Python Data Types and Operators
In this lab, I worked with basic Python data types and operators.
I reviewed numeric, sequence, mapping, set, boolean, and binary data types and practiced using different Python operators.

## Python Data Types
- Numeric types: **int, float, complex** 
- Sequence types: **str, list, tuple**
- Mapping type: **dict** 
- Set types: **set, frozenset** 
- Boolean type: **bool** 
- Binary types: **bytes, bytearray**

## Python Operators
- Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
- Comparison operators: **==, !=, >, <, >=, <=**
- Logical operators: **and, or, not**
- Bitwise operators: **&, |, ^, ~**
- Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Identity operators: **is, is not**
- Membership operators: **in, not in**

## Exercise

I created a program that:
- Takes user input (integer, float, string) and prints their data types
- Converts a string to an integer and then to a float
- Creates a dictionary with personal information and accesses its values
- Performs basic set operations (add, remove, membership check)
