# Lab 7

# Control Flow in Python

## What I did
In this lab, I studied Python control flow using conditional statements and loops.
I practiced writing programs with if, elif, and else, as well as using for and while loops.

## Conditional Statements
I worked with different types of conditions in Python:
- `if` statement to execute code when a condition is true
- `else` statement to handle false conditions
- `elif` statement to check multiple conditions
- Nested `if` statements for more complex logic
- Conditional (ternary) expressions
- Combining conditions using logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

## Loops in Python
- `for` loop to iterate over sequences and ranges
- `while` loop to run code while a condition is true
- `break` statement to stop a loop
- `continue` statement to skip an iteration
- `else` clause with loops
- Nested loops for more complex iterations
- Understanding and avoiding infinite loops

## Exercise

I completed the following tasks:
- Printed numbers from 1 to 10 using both for and while loops
- Iterated over the string "Python" and printed each character
- Used a while loop to print even numbers from 2 to 10
